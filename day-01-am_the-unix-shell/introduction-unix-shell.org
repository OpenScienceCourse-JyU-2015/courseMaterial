#+TITLE: Introduction to the Unix shell

** Before the course

Prerequisites:
- you have used a computer before and you are know what are "files" and
  "directories" or "folders" on a computer

** After the course

You will know how to:
- connect to a remote server
- navigate around files and folders from the command line
- create, copy, move and delete files and folders
- run programs from the command line
- combine commands to perform complex operations
- create scripts to automate task

* What is the shell?

In brief:
- Command-line interface, looks old-fashioned but very convenient
- Main interface when you want to login to *remote servers* (e.g. CSC servers)
- Also present in *Linux* distributions for personal computers and *Macs*
- With *Windows*, the =cmd= prompt is a bit similar (text-based) but not as
  powerful

Usage:
- Often the only interface for remote connections
- Powerful built-in commands
- *Automate repetitive tasks*
- Shell scripts to *reproduce* data manipulation

* Where can we find the shell?

To find a shell:
- On *GNU/Linux* and *MacOS* systems: open a *terminal*. This will provide you
  with a Unix-like shell on both systems.
- On *Windows*: run =cmd.exe= or =cmd=. This shell is quite different from the
  Unix-like shell found in Linux and MacOS. To obtain a Unix shell on Windows,
  one caninstall the Cygwin tools.
- It is strongly recommended to learn how to use a *Unix shell* since it is
  very likely it is this type of shell you will be exposed to when you connect
  to a *remote server*.

** One shell or several shells?

- A shell: a program providing an *interface* between the user and the
  computer. *Different shells exist*.
- The most popular ad widely used shell is probably *bash*. It is the default
  shell in most GNU/Linux distributions.
- If you learn how to use *bash*, you will be able to use most *remote servers*
  you'll have to connect to, and also the *terminal* from MacOS or the *Cygwin*
  tools on Windows.

*One word on terminology:* During the course, we will often say interchangeably
 "the terminal", "the console", "the shell" or "bash".
