In brief:
- Command-line interface, looks old-fashioned but very convenient
- Main interface when you want to login to *remote servers* (e.g. CSC servers)
- Also present in *Linux* distributions for personal computers and *Macs*
- With *Windows*, the =cmd= prompt is a bit similar (text-based) but not as
  powerful

Usage:
- Often the only interface for remote connections
- Powerful built-in commands
- *Automate repetitive tasks*
- Shell scripts to *reproduce* data manipulation

*Note:* the words /shell/, /terminal/ and /console/ are *roughly* (but not
 exactly) synonyms and will be used interchangeably during this course.
