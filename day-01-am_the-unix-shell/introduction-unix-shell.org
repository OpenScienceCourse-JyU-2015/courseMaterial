* What is the shell?

In brief:
- Command-line interface, looks old-fashioned but very convenient
- Main interface when you want to login to *remote servers* (e.g. CSC servers)
- Also present in *Linux* distributions for personal computers and *Macs*
- With *Windows*, the =cmd= prompt is a bit similar (text-based) but not as
  powerful

- Powerful built-in commands
- *Automate repetitive tasks*
