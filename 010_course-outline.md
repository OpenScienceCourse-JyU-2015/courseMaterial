Durations of each section are very rough estimates. If we are going faster or
slower than expected, some topics may be treated earlier or later, or
altogether skipped if more time is spent on another topic in which people have
more interest. You can access our Etherpad

# Final project (day three)

The end of the third day will be devoted to the students working as several
small groups within a team to distribute tasks, write, test and share code in
order to create a small and complete Python module. The purpose of the module
can be a project proposed by the students themselves (the preferred options) or
chosen by the teachers.

# Later on...?

A follow-up session might take place later in the year if enough people are
interested in it.
