# Presentation of Python

- Python is an interpreted language (distinction compiled/interpreted)
- Python is widely used in the scientific community (examples of projects using
  Python, e.g. BioPython, modeller)
- There are a lot of libraries available (e.g. Numpy, BioPython, matplotlib,
  pandas) and a large community
- Python is multi-platform (if it works on your laptop, it should work on the
  CSC servers)
- We are going to teach Python 3

# Installation of Python

- How to install Python on a Windows or Mac machine
- How to install Ipython
- Set up the working environment (do we use an IDE, or just a simple text
  editor associated with a console window running Ipython?)

# Basics of Python

- Variables (assignment, int, float, strings, lists, dicts)
- Operations
- Writing a script, comments
- Flow control (if, then, for, while)
- Reading from and writing to a file
- Using the Python documentation (e.g. the tutorial and the library manual,
  pdfs from the Python docs)

# Modulable code

- Functions
- Parsing arguments from the command line
- Introduction to documentation for functions
- Separating functions to a separate file (beginning of module writing)
- Advanced: references and copies in Python (important point, it is a dangerous
  pitfall when one is not aware of it)

# Using an existing library: example with BioPython and matplotlib

- cf. the BioPython tutorial
- Reading some fasta sequences, doing some work on them, writing them to a file
- Reading a csv file, processing it and plotting a graph with matplotlib

# End of the course: complete script

- Write a script which loads some aligned fasta sequences from a file and plot
  the residue conservation along the primary sequence
- This script can be used as an example material for the version control course
