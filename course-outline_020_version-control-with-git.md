Summary: Description of the version control course
Status: hidden

Some material is already available in Matthieu's presentation about
reproducible research with R.

We can assume that we wrote a working script in the previous session about
Python's basics.

# Presentation and interest of version control

- Issues when code is not version-controlled
- How version control works: history, branches, merging
- Interest of version control for collaborative work and for single developper
  (the single developper case will be developped in more details later)
- Tools: SVN, **Git**
- Online servers for repositories: GitHub and BitBucket, differences between
  the two

# Installation of Git

- Install Git, set up the PATH for accessing it from the command line

# How to use Git locally

- Second commit
- Diff between files
- How to revert to a previous version
- Branching and merging
- Resolving merge conflicts

# Setting up a remote repository

- Set up a GitHub account
- Create a new repository
- Push to the new repository

# Cloning an existing project
