#+TITLE: FROM DATA TO ANALYSIS: A CASE STUDY

** Before the course

Prerequisites:
- understanding what is *tidy data* (and what is not)
- basic *SQL* skills
- *version control* skills with Git
- basic knowledge of *programming with Python*

** After the course

This session is mostly aimed at putting together the foundations laid during
the previous two days of the bootcamp through a case study example.

During this session you will practice:
- *cloning* a remote repository
- being *critical* of dataset formats
- writing *Python functions*
- *keeping track* of your code
- *sharing* your code with others

However, some more advanced topics will also be introduced during the
processing of the course data.

After completing this course you will know:
- how to load data from a database using *Pandas*
- how to make plots using *matplotlib*

* 1. Case study introduction: the evolution of fish mitochondrial proteins

** Once upon a time...

- Mitochondrial genomes encode some proteins which are essential to the
  production of ATP by the cell mitochondrias through oxidative
  phosphorylation.

- You are an *evolutionary biologist* interested in *how those key proteins
  have evolved in fishes living in different habitats*, since different
  environments might exert different selection pressures on the cell energy
  machinery.

- There is a lot of *ecological* and *genomic data* about fish that have
  already been produced by the scientific community. There must be a way to
  leverage this knowledge by combining and analyzing these data together to get
  insights into fish protein evolution!

** What was done before

- Some of your colleagues have been gathering data from the *public
  repositories* already (GenBank and FishBase), and have started to store it in
  a more or less *tidy format in sqlite databases*.

- Because your colleagues know how important it is to provide a full record of
  how data is acquired and processed, they put everything into a
  *version-controlled repository*.

** What you must do

- Your task is to *clone locally* this repository and to use it as a *starting
  point for your own work**

- The files you will be using to start with are:
  + *fishbase_data.sqlite*
  + *aa_properties.sqlite*

- Your mission:
  + *Load* and *explore* the data from the two provided SQLite databases
  + Gather all the useful data into *one single, tidy dataset*
  + *Each student pair* will write some Python code to calculate the average
    value of a specific *biochemical property* (e.g. hydrophobicity,
    flexibility) for each protein
  + *Share* your code and results and *merge* it into the master repository
  + Use this *collaborative work* to explore the relation between *fish ecology*
    and *protein evolution*

* 2. Clone the remote repository

- The repository which will be used for this session is:
  + https://github.com/OpenScienceCourse-JyU-2015/day-03-case-study

- You must clone locally this repository to your own computer. At this stage,
  you should be able to do it by yourself (but call the teachers if you have
  any trouble).

- All students who have a GitHub account will now be added as *owner* of the
  repository. This gives each student the administrative rights needed to push
  their modifications to the repository.

* 3. Load and explore the data from the SQLite databases

- Load the datasets into Python

- Examine the tables: are they tidy? If not, how to make them tidy?

- Which data will we need later on?

* 4. Produce a single, tidy dataset for the rest of the analyses

- Use Python and Pandas to prepare a single, tidy dataset

- Remember to keep track of your code: commit your changes!

- Share your work with your collaborators; here we will keep only one version
  of the tidy dataset in the repository, and everyone will clone it back
  locally.

* 5. By groups: calculate protein biochemical properties

- Each group (pair) chooses one biochemical property they are interested in.

- Write some Python code to calculate, for a protein sequence given as a
  string, the average value of this biochemical property.

- Apply this function to the tidy dataset to calculate this property for all
  proteins, for all species. Is it working properly?

* 6. Share your code with your collaborators

- Each group will run their code, commit their changes and push to the remote
  repository one after the other.

- By the end of this part, the remote repository will contain a complete tidy
  dataset and all the code needed to reproduce it.

* 7. Explore the relation between fish ecology and protein evolution

- Pull the changes to the repository in order to get a full, updated copy of
  the dataset and of the code from your collaborators

- Use Pandas and matplotlib to explore graphically the relationship between
  fish ecology and their protein biochemical properties.

* Teacher's notes

Course:
1. students clone the data repo (git refresh)
2. importing the data with python and pandas (from python intro but new thing:
   SQL)
3. data exploration and clean-up (dna seqs in proteins) (more pandas, maybe
   already some plotting with matplotlib)
4. data processing! writing some functions (one function per group), creating
   new columns (python)
5. commit all together, pull updated code
6. final data visualization (pandas and matplotlib)
