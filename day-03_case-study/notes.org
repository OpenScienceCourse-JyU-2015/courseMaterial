* Plan

- context: some fish data with species + habitats, species + protein sequences
- all this provided in one sqlite db
- sqlite db in its own repo (github)

Course:
1. students clone the data repo (git refresh)
2. importing the data with python and pandas (from python intro but new thing:
   SQL)
3. data exploration and clean-up (dna seqs in proteins) (more pandas, maybe
   already some plotting with matplotlib)
4. data processing! writing some functions (one function per group), creating
   new columns (python)
5. commit all together, pull updated code
6. final data visualization (pandas and matplotlib)
