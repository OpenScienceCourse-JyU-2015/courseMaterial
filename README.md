Repository for the Introduction to Open Science course, to 
be held in Jyväskylä in November 2016

For now most of the files are directly copied from a "software carpentry-like"
(but not officially part of SC) course which took place in Turku in 2015 and
was prepared by Carlos Peña and Matthieu Bruneaux.

Those files can serve as a base for modifications, or just be deleted, as
needed :)
