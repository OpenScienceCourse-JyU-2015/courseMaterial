## Important practical details

Most of the course will be hands-on work. Workstations running Windows will be
provided, but students can bring their own laptop with a wireless internet
connection if they wish. **Eduroam** is available at the University.

The material taught is platform-independent and should work with Windows,
GNU/Linux and MacOS systems. The students who wish to use their own laptop are
expected to have installed the necessary software on their machine before they
attend the course. System-specific instructions are usually found on the
software web sites:

- A spreadsheet program. If you already have Microsoft Excel then great,
  otherwise you can download [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), which
  is an free and open-source office suite.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Yes, specifically this
  browser! We will use it to learn SQL with a Firefox add-on.
- [SQLite manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/)
  for Firefox. See installation instructions here if needed:
  http://apawlik.github.io/2015-03-18-csc-espoo/#setup
- A program for ssh connection:
  + Windows: [Putty](http://www.putty.org/) or equivalent
  + Linux and Mac users: we will use ssh, which is already installed by default
    on your machines
- Git and Git GUI. 
  + Windows users: https://git-for-windows.github.io/
  + Mac users: https://git-scm.com/download/mac 
  + Linux users can install Git here: https://git-scm.com/download/linux and
    Git GUI here: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg/
- An Anaconda installation of Python 3.5. This will install Python, Jupyter
  notebook and a whole bunch of usefull Python libraries:
  https://www.continuum.io/downloads
- A text editor with syntax highlighting.
  + For Windows we suggest [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
  + For Mac two good alternatives are [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) and
    [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/download.html)
  + Linux users can install [Geany](https://www.geany.org/) or
    [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit)

## Other resources

These are online resources of interest for people attending the bootcamp.

#### Software and Data Carpentry

If you must only visit two sites, those are the ones! Software and Data
Carpentry provides a lot of great material to improve researchers skills in
informatics. The content of this bootcamp was heavily inspired by or modified
from those sites:

- http://software-carpentry.org/
- http://www.datacarpentry.org/

### General Python material

If you would like to learn more about Python, here are some pointers:

- [The official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [A list of courses](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTraining)

### Version control with Git documentation

Git is a powerful tool which can be used either from the command line or with a
graphical user interface. Of particular interest for R users is the tight
integration of Git with RStudio, which makes it very simple to use for your R
projects.
