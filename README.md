# OpenScience course in Jyväskylä, November 2016

This is the repository for the Introduction to Open Science course, to be held
in Jyväskylä in November 2016. This repository contains the **course material
used for the practicals**.

For the home website of the course, please visit the
[course wiki](https://github.com/OpenScienceCourse-JyU-2015/courseMaterial/wiki).

## Work in progress!

For now most of the files are directly copied from a "software carpentry-like"
(but not officially part of SC) course which took place in Turku in 2015 and
was prepared by Carlos Peña and Matthieu Bruneaux.

Those files can serve as a base for modifications, or just be deleted, as
needed :)
