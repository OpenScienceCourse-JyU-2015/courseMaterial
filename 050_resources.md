# Version control

## Git documentation

- [Git website](http://git-scm.com/)
- [The Pro Git book by Scott Chacon](http://git-scm.com/book)
- [The reference manual](http://git-scm.com/docs)
- [Git graphical user interfaces](http://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux)

## Workflows

- [Using Git with Dropbox](http://blog.shvetsov.com/2013/04/using-git-with-dropbox.html)
- [Using Dropbox as a private GitHub](http://jetheis.com/blog/2013/02/17/using-dropbox-as-a-private-github/)
- [What you should not do](http://xkcd.com/1296/)

# Papers about scientific computing

- [Noble's "A quick guide to organizing computational biology projects"](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)
- [Wilson's "Best Practices for scientific computing"](TODO_ADD_LINK)

# Website preparation

Software Carpentry has a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc)
which explains how to generate a website and host it on GitHub.
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is the static site generator of choice
for GitHub, is written in Ruby, but
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.4.0/index.html) is a good alternative
written in Python for that. It uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) for code
syntax highlighting. A detailed explanation about how to publish on GitHub with
Pelican is available [here](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.4.0/tips.html).

# Bioinformatic course existing at Utu

There is a Master's program at UTU on
[Bioinformatics](https://nettiopsu.utu.fi/opas/tutkintoOhjelma.htm?rid=22413&uiLang=fi&lang=en&lvv=2014).

*Please note that we do not intend this course to be a bioinformatic course:
our objective is only to expose researchers who have to use computer tools for
their research but do not have a formal IT education to some key concepts for a
better use of their tools.*
