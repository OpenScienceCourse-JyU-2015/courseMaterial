## Presentation of Python
## There are many programming languages nowadays.

## Programming languages for all needs, tastes and categories.

## Popularity of Python versus R in data science:

## Python is a language used for a wide variety of purposes:

* Awesome Python <https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python>

## Let's choose Python for this workshop:

![Quora](img/choose_python1.png)
    
* Python is language with a precise, simple and efficient syntax.
* Thus, it is easy to write, read and understand code.
* Python has libraries for statistic analysisa and plotting of data,
  comparable to those in R:  **NumPy, matplotlib and SciPy**.
* There are popular toolkits for bioinformatics such as BioPython.

## Installation of Python
* Python2 versus Python3. To install, or not to install, that is the question. 
  Let's install Python 3.4.3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-343/>
  
* Install IPython:

```shell
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ipython
```

## Basics of Python
* We will do some exercises before writing *real code*. Fire up IPython from 
your command line:

```shell
ipython
```

```ipython
Python 3.3.2+ (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:52:16) 
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

IPython 2.3.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
%quickref -> Quick reference.
help      -> Python's own help system.
object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

* Explore variables, strings, integers, floats, lists, dictionaries.
* Explore operations **+, -, \*, /, +=, -=**
* Explore conditionals: **if...else**
* Explore loops: **for, while**
* Explore booleans: True, False, None, and boolean operations **and, or, not**.
* Explore comparisons: **<, <=, >=, ==, !=, is, is not**
* Comments and docstrings.
* Operations on strings, integers, lists, list indexes, concatenation, etc.

## Modulable code
* Imagine you need to run a series of instructions in Python code many times.
  Imagine that your colleague would like to run this code. 
  **You should write modular code**.
* Writing modular code involves several steps.

### Functions

* Indenting.
* Name your variables with :heart: [Uncle Bob says](https://youtu.be/3rtZcXSkKDc)
* Python gurus say that a **function** is an *object* that can accept arguments
  and possibly return another *object*.
* I say that a **function** is a series of **instructions** designed to do only
  one thing. And it should do it lovely.
  
```python
def my_cool_function_name(argument1, argument2):
    # do cool stuf with my two arguments
    # if you want to return something, use the keyword return
```

* Task 1: write a function that performs the complement of three nucleotides
  of DNA, a codon:
    * Input is a codon sequence: **ATG**
    * Output is the reverse complement: **TAC**
    * Save your code into a file named **seq_utils.py**

* Task 2: write a function that performs the complement of a long DNA
  sequence:
    * Input is a sequence: **ATGAAAATCCCGGTAAAACCT**
    * Output is the reverse complement: **TACTTTTAGGGCCATTTTGGA**
    * Save your code into **the same** file **seq_utils.py**
    
### Modules
* Python gurus say that a **module** is a simple way to structure your Python 
  code.
* Modules can be files with python code, or folder with several files with python
  code.
* A crucial benefit of organizing your code this way is that modules can borrow
  python code by importing each other. Modules import modules.
  
### Using an existing library
* Modules of python code, also known as libraries, can be imported into your
  project by using the keyword **import**.
* We can import the code in your **seq_utils.py** and use its functions
  in another project:
  
```python
import seq_utils

complemented_codon = seq_utils.complement_codon('ATC')
print(complemented_codon)
```

* You can also do fancier imports. Explore.
* There are thousands of thousands of Python libraries for you to import (but
  you will have to install them first). We will continue this on the last day
  of the course.
